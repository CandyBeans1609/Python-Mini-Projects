# PDF Merger Script

This guide demonstrates how to implement a script that merges multiple PDF files into a single PDF file. The script uses the `PyPDF2` library for manipulating PDF files and the `os` library for handling file paths and directories.

## üåü Explanation

- **PDF Merging**: The script combines multiple PDF files into a single PDF document.
- **Directory Handling**: Sets the working directory to the folder containing the PDFs and processes files in that directory.
- **File Processing**: Uses `PyPDF2` to append each PDF to the final merged document.
- **Output**: Saves the merged PDF in the same directory.

<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- **Basic Python Knowledge**: Understanding of Python syntax, functions, and file handling.
- **Familiarity with PDF Files**: Basic knowledge of PDF file structure and manipulation.
- **Required Libraries**: `PyPDF2` library for working with PDF files.

<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Ensure the script is saved as** `merge_pdf.py`:
    - Copy the provided script code and save it as `merge_pdf.py`.

2. **Install the required library**:
    ```bash
    pip install PyPDF2
    ```

   This will install:

   - `PyPDF2`: a library for manipulating PDF files.

3. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python merge_pdf.py
    ```

<br>

The script will merge all PDF files in the specified directory and save the result as `merged-pdf.pdf` in the same directory.


## Calculating Factorials Using a Recursive Python Function

In this program, we will explore how to calculate the factorial of a number using a recursive function in Python. Factorial calculations are a fundamental concept in mathematics, often used in statistics, combinatorics, and various fields of computer science. The factorial of a non-negative integer 
n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 
n.

## üåü How it works

The program calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. The function fact is defined to take an integer n as input. If n is 0 or 1, the function returns 1, as the factorial of these numbers is 1. For any other positive integer, the function calls itself with n-1 and multiplies the result by n. This process continues until the base case (when n is 0 or 1) is reached.

## üìú Conclusion

This simple program demonstrates how to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion in Python. Recursion is a powerful tool for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, repetitive tasks. Understanding how to implement and use recursive functions will enhance your problem-solving skills in Python programming.

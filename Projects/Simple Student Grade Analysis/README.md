# Simple Student Grades Analysis

This guide demonstrates how to implement a script that processes a list of student grades, calculates the average grade, filters out students who scored above a certain grade, and sorts students by their grades using Python. The script leverages lambda functions, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

## 🌟 Explanation

- **Student Grades List**: The script processes a predefined list of student names and their corresponding grades.
- **Average Grade Calculation**: Uses `map` to extract grades and `reduce` to calculate the average.
- **Grade Filtering**: Utilizes `filter` to find students who scored above a certain threshold.
- **Grade Sorting**: Uses `sorted` with a lambda function to sort students by their grades in descending order.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- **Basic Python Knowledge**: Understanding of Python syntax, functions, and loops.
- **Familiarity with Lambda Functions**: Basic knowledge of how to use lambda functions in Python.
- **Understanding of Higher-order Functions**: Knowledge of `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. **Ensure the script is saved as** `grades_analysis.py`:
    - Copy the provided script code and save it as `grades_analysis.py`.

2. **Run the script**:
    ```python
    python3 grades_analysis.py
    ```

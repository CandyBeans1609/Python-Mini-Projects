## Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This guide demonstrates how to implement a simple Fibonacci sequence generator using Python. The generator will output the sequence up to a specified number of terms, leveraging Python's `yield` keyword for efficient memory usage.

## 🌟 Explanation

- **Fibonacci Sequence**: A series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
- **Generator Function**: A special type of function in Python that returns an iterator using the `yield` keyword, allowing for efficient memory use.
- **Python Basics**: Utilizes fundamental Python concepts such as loops, variables, and tuple unpacking.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- **Basic Python Knowledge**: Understanding of Python syntax, functions, and loops.
- **Familiarity with Iterators**: Basic knowledge of iterators and generators in Python.
- **Understanding of Fibonacci Sequence**: Knowledge of how the Fibonacci sequence is constructed.

## 📜 Conclusion

Using a generator function to implement the Fibonacci sequence in Python provides an efficient way to generate the sequence without storing all values in memory. This approach is particularly useful for generating large sequences or working in memory-constrained environments. The use of `yield` enables the function to produce the next value on demand, making it a powerful tool for handling large datasets or streams of data.

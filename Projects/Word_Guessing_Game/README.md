In this game, there is a list of words present, out of which one random word will be chosen. The user first has to input their names and then, will be asked to guess any alphabet. If the random word contains that alphabet, it will be shown as the output else the program will ask you to guess another alphabet. The user will be given 15 turns to guess the complete word.




## Information
random module: Sometimes we want the computer to pick a random number in a given range, pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin, etc. The random module provides access to functions that support these types of operations. One such operation is random.choice() method (returns a random item from a list, tuple, or string.) that we are going to use in order to select one random word from a list of words that weâ€™ve created.

## System of Lines Plotting

This Python notebook provides a guide to plotting a system of up to three lines using interactive sliders. Users can adjust the parameters of the lines, including slopes and intercepts, as well as the range of x-values, to see real-time updates to the plot. This interactive approach helps visualize how changes in line parameters affect their graphical representation.

## üåü Explanation

This Python notebook offers a hands-on approach to plotting lines with adjustable parameters using interactive widgets. It includes:

- **Plotting Lines**: Learn how to define and plot up to three lines with customizable slopes and intercepts.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Adjust parameters and the x-axis range using sliders to see dynamic updates to the plot.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Experience how changes in the parameters affect the plotted lines and their intersections.

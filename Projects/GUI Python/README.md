## System of Lines Plotting

This Python notebook provides a guide to plotting a system of up to three lines using interactive sliders. Users can adjust the parameters of the lines, including slopes and intercepts, as well as the range of x-values, to see real-time updates to the plot. This interactive approach helps visualize how changes in line parameters affect their graphical representation.

## 📜 Conclusion

Using the `pandas` library to implement file handling operations in Python provides an efficient way to manage records in CSV files. This approach is particularly useful for small to medium-sized datasets. The use of `pandas` functions like `to_csv` and `read_csv` enables easy manipulation and querying of data, making it a powerful tool for file handling tasks.
